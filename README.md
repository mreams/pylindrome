# pylindrome

A simple code sample of a palindrome checker in python. The code is in palindrome.py and the tests are in palindrome_test.py. Note that this code was written for python 2.7 as that's what I happened to have installed already.

# tests

Run the tests with py.test palindrome_test.py

ps No I'm not sorry about the terrible pun in the name ;)
